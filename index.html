    <h1>Let & Const Exercise-</h1>

    <h2>Quiz:</h2>

    <p><b><i>Questions</i></b></p>
    <ol>What is the difference between var and let?</ol>
    <ol>What is the difference between var and const?</ol>
    <ol>What is the difference between let and const?</ol>
    <ol>What is hoisting?</ol>

    <p><b><i>Answers</i></b></p>
    <ol>When you are declaring a variable using the <b>“var keyword”</b> the value can be changed by way of
        re-declaring and re-assigning. However, when you're declaring a variable using the <b>“let keyword”</b> the
        value can be changed by way of re-assigning, but unlike the <b>“var keyword”</b> it can't be redeclared.
    </ol>

    <ol>Once again if you're declaring a variable using the <b>“var keyword”</b> the value can be changed by way of
        re-declaring and re-assigning. But when using the <b>“const keyword”</b> and you're declaring a variable,
        unlike <b>“var and let”</b>, after the original assignment of the value for <b>“const”</b>, you can't
        reassign or redeclare it.
    </ol>

    <ol>Just for clarification when you're declaring a variable using the <b>“let keyword”</b> the value can be
        changed by way of re-assigning but not re-decloration. When you're declaring a variable using <b>"const"</b>
        Once you've assigned a value to it, you'll be unable to reassign or redeclare it.
    </ol>

    <ol>In JavaScript, hoisting means that variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope
        during code execution. This allows you to use them before they are formally written in your code.
    </ol>
